\section{The QCD Continuum Action}
The aim of this chapter is to write the Yang-Mills action on the lattice. In order to do so, the Yang-Mills theory is obtained firstly in the continuum, beginning from the simplest case, Quantum Electrodynamics.\\
The first section is mostly taken from Srednicki\cite{srednicki2007quantum}, personal notes and computations.

\subsection{Dirac Spinor Fields}
Let us take into consideration a (free) quantum field theory describing a fermion, such as a quark or a lepton, in a $4$-dimensional spacetime with metric $\eta_{\mu\nu} = \diag(-1,1,1,1)$. Its action (in natural units, where $c = \hslash = 1$) can be written as:
\begin{equation}
      S_\psi[\psi(x),\psibar(x)] = \dV \left( \i\psibar\slashed\partial\psi - m\psibar\psi \right) \label{1:FreeQEDFermionAction}
\end{equation}
from which, upon the application of the variational principle, the Dirac equation follows:
\begin{equation}
    \left( \i\slashed\partial-m \right) \psi(x) = 0 \label{1:DiracEq}
\end{equation}
It can now be easily checked by direct computation that this action is invariant under a rigid (global) phase transformation, also called a global $U(1)$ transformation:
\begin{align*}
    \psi(x) &\rightarrow \psi'(x) = e^{-\i\alpha}\psi(x) \numthis\label{1:PhaseTransform} \\
    \psibar(x) &\rightarrow \psibar'(x) = \psibar(x) e^{\i\alpha}
\end{align*}
where $\alpha$ is a constant that does not depend on the spacetime coordinate $x$, while if $\alpha=\alpha(x)$ the action \eqref{1:FreeQEDFermionAction} would not be invariant because of the kinetic term.

\subsection{Quantum Electrodynamics\label{Sec:QED}}
As the free field theory itself is non interacting, it does not provide any real-world prediction, so it is useful to write an interacting action where the spinor field is coupled, for instance, to a vector field $A_\mu$, \ie the photon.
One way to implement this interaction is to ask for local, instead of global, invariance of the action \eqref{1:FreeQEDFermionAction} under the phase transformation \eqref{1:PhaseTransform}, where now $\alpha=\alpha(x)$.
In order to do so, one has to define the covariant derivative as follows:
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu+\i g A_\mu \label{1:QEDCovDeriv}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the couplig constant.\footnote{Usually, in QED, $g$ is called $e$, the electron charge, though $g$ will be used in analogy to nonabelian gauge theories.}\\
The vector field's kinetic term is written in terms of its field-strength, namely:
\begin{align*}
    \Fmunu\equiv& -\frac{\i}{g}\left[D_\mu,D_\nu\right] = \\
    =& -\frac{\i}{g}\pr{D_\mu\pr{\partial_\nu+\i g A_\nu} - D_\nu\pr{\partial_\mu+\i g A_\mu}}=\\
    =& -\frac{\i}{g}\pr{\cancel{\partial_\mu\partial_\nu} + \i g\partial_\mu A_\nu -g^2A_\mu A_\nu - \cancel{\partial_\nu\partial_\mu} - \i g\partial_\nu A_\mu + g^2A_\nu A_\mu}=\\
    =& \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \i g\comm{A_\mu}{A_\nu}=\\
    =& \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \numthis\label{1:FieldStrU1}
\end{align*}
where $\comm{A_\mu}{A_\nu}=A_\mu A_\nu-A_\nu A_\mu=0$ in the abelian theory.\\
Two different fields $A_\mu$ and $A_\mu'$ describe the same physics if one can be obtained from another throug a gauge transformation:
\begin{align*}
    A_\mu'(x) =& A_\mu(x) + \frac1g \partial_\mu\alpha(x) \numthis\label{1:QEDGaugeTransf} \\
    \Fmunu' = \Fmunu + \frac1g&\left( \partial_\mu\partial_\nu-\partial_\nu\partial_\mu \right)\alpha(x) = \Fmunu
\end{align*}
Thus, the free action for the vector field is:
\begin{equation}
    S_{EM} = -\frac14\dV F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} \label{1:FreeMaxwellAction}
\end{equation}
That is also gauge invariant, i.e. invariant under \eqref{1:QEDGaugeTransf}, as $\Fmunu$ is gauge invariant.\\
The term that broke the local phase invariance of the action \eqref{1:FreeQEDFermionAction} can now be ``absorbed'' by $A_\mu$ through a gauge transformation \eqref{1:QEDGaugeTransf}, thus making the full action gauge invariant:
\begin{align*}
    S_{QED} =& \dV\pr{\i\psibar\slashed{D}\psi-m\psibar\psi -\frac14\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}} = \numthis\label{1:QEDaction}\\
    =& \dV\pr{\i\psibar\slashed{\partial}\psi-m\psibar\psi- g \psibar\slashed{A}\psi - \frac14\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}}\\
    S_{QED} \rightarrow S_{QED}' =& \dV\pr{\i\psibar\slashed{\partial}\psi +\psibar\slashed{\partial}\alpha\psi -m\psibar\psi -g \psibar\slashed{A}\psi -\psibar\slashed\partial\alpha\psi -\frac14\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}}=\\
    =& \dV\pr{\i\psibar\slashed{\partial}\psi-m\psibar\psi- g \psibar\slashed{A}\psi - \frac14\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}} = S_{QED}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Nonabelian Gauge Theories}
Let us now consider a theory with $N$ fermions all with the same mass $m$, described by the spinorial fields $\psi_i(x)$ with $i=1, \dots, N$. Its free action is:
\begin{equation}
    S_\psi[\psi_i(x),\psibar_i(x)] = \sum_{i=1}^N\dV\pr{\i\psibar_i\slashed\partial\psi_i - m\psibar_i\psi_i} \label{1:FreeFermionAction}
\end{equation}
From now on, the sum over $i$ (and all other repeated latin indexes) will be omitted, unless specified differently.
This action is invariant under the global transformation:
\begin{align*}
    \psi_i(x) &\rightarrow \psi_i'(x) = \U\psi_j(x) \numthis\label{1:UNTransform}\\
    \psibar_i(x) &\rightarrow \psibar_i'(x) = \psibar_j(x)\Udag
\end{align*}
if $U$ is any (constant) $N\times N$ matrix such that $UU^\dagger = U^\dagger U = \id \Leftrightarrow U^\dagger=U^{-1}$, or in other words, if $U\in\UN$.
For this reason, this transformation is also called a global $\UN$ transformation.
The phase transformation \eqref{1:PhaseTransform} is the particular case where $U=e^{-\i\alpha}\in\Uem$, that is the only abelian (commutative) unitary group.\\
As $\UN = \SUN\otimes\Uem$ $\forall N>1$, $U\in\SUN$ instead of $U\in\UN$ can be imposed, and will be from now on, without loss of generality.\\
In an analogous way to what has been done in\secref{Sec:QED}, this invariance can be made local by implementing a proper covariant derivative, similar to \eqref{1:QEDCovDeriv}.
In order to do so, the infinitesimal $\SUN$ transformation has to be considered:
\begin{equation}
    U_{ij}(x) = \delta_{ij} + \i\theta^a(x)\pr{T^a}_{ij} + O(\theta^2) \label{1:InfinitesimalSUN}
\end{equation}
where the indices $i$ and $j$ run from $1$ to $N$ (as before) and the index $a$ runs from $1$ to $N^2-1$ (the dimension of the group $\SUN$).
The matrixes $T^a$ are the $N^2-1$ generators of $\SUN$, thus they are $\NxN$ hermitean and traceless, which obey the commutation relations:
\begin{equation}
    \comm{T^a}{T^b} = \i f^{abc}T^c \label{1:StrConstSUN}
\end{equation}
where $f^{abc}$ are called \emph{structure constants} of $\SUN$. The normalization of these matrices can be chosen such that they obey the condition:
\begin{equation}
    \Tr{T^aT^b} = \frac12\delta^{ab} \label{1:NormCondSUN}
\end{equation}
some examples are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N=2$, $T^a=\frac{\sigma^a}{2}$, with $\sigma^a$ the Pauli matrices;
    \item $N=3$, $T^a=\frac{\lambda^a}{2}$, with $\lambda^a$ the Gell-Mann matrices.
\end{itemize}
In both those examples, the structure constants are $f^{abc}=\epsilon^{abc}$, the completely antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol.\\
The covariant derivative, therefore, is written as:
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu + \i g \A_\mu(x) \label{1:CovDeriv}
\end{equation}
where an $N\times N$ identity matrix $\id$ multiplying $\partial_\mu$ has to be understood, and $\A_\mu(x)$ is a gauge field of $\SUN$, \ie a traceless, hermitean $N\times N$ matrix, or, in other words, $\A_\mu(x)\in\sun$, the Lie algebra of $\SUN$.\\
The covariant derivative can be written more explicitly acting on the set of spinors $\psi_i$:
\begin{equation*}
    \pr{D_\mu}_{ij}\psi_j = \partial_\mu \id_{ij}\psi_j + \i g \A_\mu(x)_{ij}\psi_j
\end{equation*}
In order for the action to be gauge invariant, the field $\A_\mu$ must satisfy the gauge transformation property
\begin{equation}
    \A_\mu(x) \rightarrow \A_\mu'(x) = U(x)\A_\mu(x)U^\dagger(x) - \frac{\i}{g}U(x)\partial_\mu U^\dagger(x) \label{1:GaugeTransformSUN}
\end{equation}
This expression is a little more complicated than \eqref{1:QEDGaugeTransf}, due to the fact that $\A_\mu$ is now a non-commuting matrix. However if the abelian case $\Uem$ is taken into consideration, where $U(x)=e^{-\i\alpha(x)}$, \eqref{1:QEDGaugeTransf} follows directly from \eqref{1:GaugeTransformSUN}.\\
It can now be easily checked that the kinetic term of the Lagrangian
\begin{equation*}
    \Lagr_K = \i\psibar_i\slashed{D}\psi_i = \i\psibar_i\slashed\partial\psi_i -g\psibar_i\slashed\A\psi_i
\end{equation*}
is gauge invariant (\ie invariant under \eqref{1:UNTransform} and \eqref{1:GaugeTransformSUN}) through direct computation:
\begin{align*}
    \Lagr_K \rightarrow \Lagr_K' =& \i\psibar_i U^\dagger\slashed\partial\pr{U\psi_i} -g\psibar_i\underbrace{U^\dagger U}_{\id}\slashed\A\underbrace{U^\dagger U}_{\id}\psi_i +\i\psibar_i\underbrace{U^\dagger U}_{\id}\pr{\slashed\partial U^\dagger}U\psi_i= \\
    =& \i\psibar_i U^\dagger\pr{\slashed\partial U}\psi_i +\underbrace{\i\psibar_i\slashed\partial\psi_i -g\psibar_i\slashed\A\psi_i}_{\Lagr_K} +\i\psibar_i\pr{\slashed\partial U^\dagger}U\psi_i= \\
    =& \Lagr_K +\i\psibar_i\gamma^\mu\pr{U^\dagger\partial_\mu U+ \partial_\mu U^\dagger U}\psi_i= \\
    =& \Lagr_K +\i\psibar_i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\pr{U^\dagger U}\psi_i= \\
    =& \Lagr_K +\i\psibar_i\gamma^\mu\underbrace{\partial_\mu\pr{\id}}_{=0}\psi_i = \Lagr_K
\end{align*}
Because of this fact, it is directly implied that the covariant derivative \eqref{1:CovDeriv} must transform, under a gauge transformation, as:
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu' = U D_\mu U^\dagger \label{1:GaugeTrCovDer}
\end{equation}
The field-strength for the field $\A_\mu$ is obtained, as for the abelian case, through the commutator of two covariant derivatives. The computation is the same as \eqref{1:FieldStrU1}, but this time the commutator term is not $=0$:
\begin{equation}
    \Fmunu\equiv -\frac{\i}{g}\comm{D_\mu}{D_\nu} = \partial_\mu\A_\nu -\partial_\nu\A_\mu +\i g\comm{\A_\mu}{\A_\nu} \label{1:FieldStrDef}
\end{equation}
this expression can be simplified a little by considering that $\A_\mu$ and $\Fmunu$ are elements of $\sun$, thus writing them in components of the basis $T^a$:
\begin{align}
    \A_\mu(x) =& A_\mu^a(x) T^a \label{1:AmuComp}\\
    \Fmunu(x) =& \Fmunu^a(x) T^a \label{1:FmunuComp}
\end{align}
and considering the relations \eqref{1:StrConstSUN} and \eqref{1:NormCondSUN}:
\begin{align*}
    \Fmunu^aT^a =& \pr{\partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a}T^a +\i g\comm{A_\mu^bT^b}{A_\nu^cT^c}= \\
    =& \pr{\partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a}T^a +\i gA_\mu^bA_\nu^c\underbrace{\comm{T^b}{T^c}}_{if^{bca}T^a}= \\
    =& \pr{\partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a -gf^{abc}A_\mu^bA_\nu^c}T^a \\
    \Fmunu^a =& \partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a -gf^{abc}A_\mu^bA_\nu^c \numthis\label{1:FmunuExplComp}
\end{align*}
In order to write a kinetic action for the field $\A_\mu$, a term proportional to $\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}$, like in \eqref{1:FreeMaxwellAction}, is not enough:
because of \eqref{1:GaugeTrCovDer} and the definition \eqref{1:FieldStrDef}, it must transform as $\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow U\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu} U^\dagger$, therefore it would not be gauge invariant.
In fact a gauge invariant action, called Yang-Mills action, is:
\begin{equation}
    S_{YM} = -\frac12\dV\Tr{\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}} \label{1:YMAction}
\end{equation}
because of the ciclic property of the trace.\footnote{Actually, a term proportional to $\det{\Fmunu F^{\mu\nu}}$ would be gauge invariant as well, but it would not be a suitable kinetic term as it would involve terms of higher order than $2$ in the components $\Fmunu^a$}
This action can be written in components, using \eqref{1:FmunuComp} and the trace property \eqref{1:NormCondSUN}:
\begin{equation}
    S_{YM} = -\frac12\dV\Tr{\Fmunu^a F^{b\mu\nu}T^aT^b} = -\frac14\dV\Fmunu^a F^{a\mu\nu} \label{1:YMActionComp}
\end{equation}
Here, there are two remarks that need to be done.
The first one is that, if the gauge group is taken to be $\Uem$, the action \eqref{1:YMActionComp} reduces to \eqref{1:FreeMaxwellAction}, as $a=1$ because the group $\Uem$ has only $1$ generator.
The second one is that, if non-abelian gauge groups are taken into consideration, this action naturally introduces self-interacting cubic and quartic terms, because the structure constants $f^{abc}\neq0$. This is, for example, the case for the group $\SU(2)$, that is used to describe isospin, and for the group $\SU(3)$, that is used to describe gluon interaction, \ie Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
