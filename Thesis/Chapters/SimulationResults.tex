\chapter{Simulations Results}
In this chapter original results from simulations are presented.
The code used to perform such simulations is based on the code originally developed for the calculations presented in refs.~\cite{Panero:2009tv,Mykkanen:2012ri}.

\section{Rotational Invariance Restoration}
This first section has the aim to reproduce the rotational invariance restoration of~\cite{Lang:1982tj} for the continuous group $\SU(2)$ (and not for the discrete icosahedral group $\tilde{Y}$, like explained in \secref{Sec3:RotInv}).\\
This is done by evaluating the correlator of two Polyakov loops as explained in \secref{Sec2:PolyakovLoops}, computed on two different lattices with two different values of $\beta$, corresponding to two different lattice spacings.

\subsection{Simulations Setup}
The lattices are taken to be periodic in every direction, with $n_s$ sites in each space direction ($n_s=n_x=n_y=n_z$) and $n_t$ sites in the time direction.
The lattice has, therefore, $n_s^3n_t$ sites.\\
The simulations are run from a cold start, with $2500$ thermalization steps, where each Monte Carlo step is composed of $1$ heat bath step followed by $3$ overrelaxation steps.
Since the plaquette is observed to thermalize after $O(10)$ steps in preliminary simulations with both hot and cold starts, $2500$ thermalization steps are enough to ensure full thermalization.\\
After that, $20000$ measurements are taken of every possible independent correlator between two Polyakov loops, with $100$ updates between each measurement.\\
On a lattice with $n_s$ spatial sites in each direction, only couples of Polyakov loops whose distance, in each spatial direction, is $\leq n_s/2$ are independent: for example a couple of Polyakov loops extending for $n_s/2+1$ sites in a certain direction is equivalent to the hermitian conjugate of a couple extending for $n_s/2-1$ sites, because of the periodic boundary conditions (see \eqref{2:nonzeroMomPolyakov}).
But, since the Polyakov loops correlator expectation value is real, they have the same numerical value.\\
In \figref{4F:PolyakovPeriodic} is represented a graphical visualization of this fact.

    \label{4F:PolyakovPeriodic}
\end{figure}\\
Therefore, only Polyakov correlators extending from size $(0,0,0)$ to size $(n_s/2,n_s/2,n_s/2)$ are considered.
Correlators of the same size are then averaged together and the uncorrelated empirical standard deviation is computed as an estimate of the error.

\subsection{Analysis of Data}
After checking that each correlator's mean value is real (its imaginary part is compatible with $0$), these averages are used to compute the potential, in units of the lattice spacing $a$, as:
\begin{equation}
    V(x,y,z) = -\frac{1}{n_t}\ln\expval{P(0)P^\dagger(x,y,z)} \label{4:Potential}
\end{equation}
where $(x,y,z)\in\prc{(0,0,0),\dots,\pr{\frac{n_s}{2},\frac{n_s}{2},\frac{n_s}{2}}}$.
The standard deviation is computed with the usual error propagation formula.\\
Graphics like \figref{3F:LangRebbi} are obtained considering a section of the lattices used, specifically the $xy$-plane, that is done by plotting only values of $V(x,y,z=0)$.\\
In order to verify that there are no anisotropies, all the three coordinate planes are plotted in \figref{4F:PotentialPlanes}.\\
Corresponding points in each plane are compatible with each other within the standard deviation and there is no visible difference between different coordinate planes.
This justifies choosing arbitrarily one plane for each lattice.

In order to give a more ``complete'' view, data from \figref{4F:PotentialPlanes48xy} and \figref{4F:PotentialPlanes616xy} is reflected relative to the $x$ and $y$ axis, obtaining the plots in \figref{4F:PotentialRestoration}.\\
In both \figref{4F:PotentialPlanes} and \figref{4F:PotentialRestoration} correlators of Polyakov loops far from the origin (the ones represented by blue dots, with values of the potential $\gtrsim 1.4$) were compatible with each other.
The interesting parts of these graphics are, therefore, the dots up to the dark green shade.

\subsection{Final Remarks}
It is interesting to note the resemblance of \figref{4F:PotentialRestoration} with \figref{3F:LangRebbi}, although they are obtained in different ways and for different gauge groups.
Note also that the values of $\beta$ used in these simulations were slightly higher than the ones used in \cite{Lang:1982tj}, in order to have a smaller lattice spacing that allowed a finer determination of the potential.

\section{BCT Lattice}
The code used for simulations on SH lattices has been adapted to simulate $\SUN$ gauge theories on the BCT lattice.

\subsection{Formulation of the Algorithm}
The first obvious change was the number of sites: being body-centered, this lattice has twice the sites of a SH with the same dimensions.\\
Let us assume the lattice has $L_\mu$ sites in the $\mu=t,x,y,z$ direction.
The total number of sites is, therefore, $N_{sites}=L_tL_xL_yL_z$ for a SH lattice and $N_{sites}=2L_tL_xL_yL_z$ for a BCT.

\subsubsection{Lattice Sites}
Each site has coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ where $t = 0, 1, \dots, L_t-1$, $x = 0, 1, \dots, L_x-1$, $y = 0, 1, \dots, L_y-1$ and $z = 0, 1, \dots, L_z-1$ if the lattice is a simple hypercube.
In the old code, each site was individuated by an integer $0 \leq s < N_{sites}$ obtained through the following computation:
\begin{equation}
    s = z + L_z\pr{y + L_y\pr{x + L_xt}} \label{4:siteIndexSH}
\end{equation}
and the coordinates could be obtained as:
\begin{align*}
    z =& s \mod L_z \\
    y =& \frac{s - z}{L_z} \mod L_y \\
    x =& \pr{\pr{\frac{s - z}{L_z} - y}/L_y} \mod L_x \\
    t =& \pr{\pr{\frac{s - z}{L_z} - y}/L_y - x}/L_x \numthis\label{4:siteIndexSHinverted}
\end{align*}
On a BCT lattice, each site has either all integer or all semi-integer coordinates.\\
If they are all integer, $s$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    s = 2\pr{z + L_z\pr{y + L_y\pr{x + L_xt}}} \label{4:siteIndexBCTeven}
\end{equation}
Otherwise, it is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    s = 1 + 2\pr{\prs{z} + L_z\pr{\prs{y} + L_y\pr{\prs{x} + L_x\prs{t}}}} \label{4:siteIndexBCTodd}
\end{equation}
where $\prs{x}$ represents the \emph{integer part} of $x$.\\
The inverted relation is the same as \eqref{4:siteIndexSHinverted}, but with $s$ replaced with $s/2$ if $s$ is even, otherwise, if $s$ is odd, it becomes:
\begin{align*}
    z =& \pr{\frac{s-1}{2} \mod L_z} + 0.5 \\
    y =& \pr{\frac{\frac{s-1}{2} - \prs{z}}{L_z} \mod L_y} + 0.5 \\
    x =& \pr{\pr{\pr{\frac{\frac{s-1}{2} - \prs{z}}{L_z} - \prs{y}}/L_y} \mod L_x} + 0.5 \\
    t =& \pr{\pr{\pr{\frac{\frac{s-1}{2} - \prs{z}}{L_z} - \prs{y}}/L_y - \prs{x}}/L_x} + 0.5 \numthis\label{4:siteIndexBCToddInverted}
\end{align*}
In the code, the integer $s$ is stored in the variable \texttt{site} and the coordinates $t$, $x$, $y$, $z$ are always stored in integer variables as their integer part.
An additional variable \texttt{halfInt}, that can only assume $0$ or $1$ values, is used to keep track if the coordinates are actual integers or semi-integers.

\subsubsection{Directions}
Another important part is how the different possible directions are referrd to in the code.
Each site in the SH lattice has only $8$ nearest neighbours, individuated by $4$ different directions, the vectors $\pr{1,0,0,0}$ (direction $0$), $\pr{0,1,0,0}$ (direction $1$), $\pr{0,0,1,0}$ (direction $2$), $\pr{0,0,0,1}$ (direction $3$), and their opposites.
In the old version of the code, two arrays of dimension $4N_{sites}$, \texttt{neighbour\_plus} and \texttt{neighbour\_minus}, were used to keep track of each site's nearest neighbours.\\
As explained in \secref{Sec3:BCT}, each site has $24$ nearest neighbours, in $12$ different directions.
The two arrays are therefore changed to size $12N_{sites}$, where the first $4$ directions ($0$ to $3$) are the same as the SH lattice and the $8$ new directions are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }
    \hline
    Direction & \texttt{dir\_plus}  & \texttt{dir\_minus}  \\\hline\hline
    4  & $\pr{+1/2,+1/2,+1/2,+1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,-1/2,-1/2,-1/2}$ \\\hline
    5  & $\pr{+1/2,+1/2,+1/2,-1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,-1/2,-1/2,+1/2}$ \\\hline
    6  & $\pr{+1/2,+1/2,-1/2,+1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,-1/2,+1/2,-1/2}$ \\\hline
    7  & $\pr{+1/2,-1/2,+1/2,+1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,+1/2,-1/2,-1/2}$ \\\hline
    8  & $\pr{-1/2,+1/2,+1/2,+1/2}$ & $\pr{+1/2,-1/2,-1/2,-1/2}$ \\\hline
    9  & $\pr{+1/2,+1/2,-1/2,-1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,-1/2,+1/2,+1/2}$ \\\hline
    10 & $\pr{+1/2,-1/2,-1/2,+1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,+1/2,+1/2,-1/2}$ \\\hline
    11 & $\pr{+1/2,-1/2,+1/2,-1/2}$ & $\pr{-1/2,+1/2,-1/2,+1/2}$ \\\hline
