\chapter{Simulations Results}
In this chapter original results from simulations are presented.
The code used to perform such simulations is based on the code originally developed for the calculations presented in refs.~\cite{Panero:2009tv,Mykkanen:2012ri}.

\section{Rotational Invariance Restoration}
This first section has the aim to reproduce the rotational invariance restoration of~\cite{Lang:1982tj} for the continuous group $\SU(2)$ (and not for the discrete icosahedral group $\tilde{Y}$, like explained in \secref{Sec3:RotInv}).
This is done by evaluating the correlator of two Polyakov loops as explained in \secref{Sec2:PolyakovLoops}, computed on two different lattices with two different values of $\beta$, corresponding to two different lattice spacings.
The lattices are taken to be periodic in every direction, with $n_s$ sites in each space direction ($n_s=n_x=n_y=n_z$) and $n_t$ sites in the time direction.\\
The simulations are run from a cold start, with $2500$ thermalization steps, where each Monte Carlo step is composed of $1$ heat bath step followed by $3$ overrelaxation steps.
Since the plaquette is observed to thermalize after $O(10)$ steps in preliminary simulations with both hot and cold starts, $2500$ thermalization steps are enough to ensure full thermalization.\\
After that, $5000$ measurements are taken of every possible independent correlator between two Polyakov loops.
On a lattice with $n_s$ spatial sites in each direction, only couples of Polyakov loops whose distance, in each spatial direction, is $\leq n_s/2$ are independent: for example a couple of Polyakov loops extending for $n_s/2+1$ sites in a certain direction is equivalent to the hermitian conjugate of a couple extending for $n_s/2-1$ sites, because of the periodic boundary conditions (see \eqref{2:nonzeroMomPolyakov}).
But, as the Polyakov loops correlator expectation value is real, they have the same numerical value.\\
In \figref{4F:PolyakovPeriodic} is represented a graphical visualization of this fact.

Therefore, Polyakov correlators extend only from size $(0,0,0)$ to size $(n_s/2,n_s/2,n_s/2)$.
