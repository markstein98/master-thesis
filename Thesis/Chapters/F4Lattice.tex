\section{Spacetime Symmetries Restoration}
The restoration of spacetime symmetries in the continuum limit is an important aspect of lattice field theory.
Minkowskian spacetime is invariant under the action of the Poincaré group, that includes translations, rotations in the $3$-dimensional space, and boosts.
When performing the Wick rotation, boosts become rotations in the planes formed by each one of the \emph{spacelike} axis and the euclidean time.
The euclidean spacetime is therefore invariant, in the continuum, under translations:
\begin{equation}
    x^\mu \to x^\mu + \varepsilon^\mu \label{3:TranslCont}
\end{equation}
and under rotations in $4$ dimensions:
\begin{equation}
    x^\mu \to R^\mu_\nu x^\nu \qquad\text{with}\qquad R\in\Orot(4) \label{3:RotCont}
\end{equation}
These invariances do not hold true anymore if the spacetime is discretized: a generic lattice is, in fact, invariant only under translations of multiples of the lattice spacing $a$:
\begin{equation}
    x \to x + a\mu \qquad\text{with}\qquad x\in\Lambda \label{3:TraslDiscr}
\end{equation}
and under certain rotations:
\begin{equation}
    x \to \Gamma x \qquad\text{with}\qquad x\in\Lambda, \Gamma\in G_\Lambda \label{3:RotDiscr}
\end{equation}
where $G_\Lambda\subset\Orot(4)$ is a discrete subset of the full rotational group $\Orot(4)$ that depends on the lattice $\Lambda$.
For example, $\Lambda=\Lambda_{SH}$ is a SH lattice, then $G_{\Lambda_{SH}}$ is the $384$-elements group with all possible reflections on every coordinate plane and rotations of multiples of $90^\degree$ around each one of the $4$ axis.\\
The fact that the symmetries between the discrete and the continuum cases are different is not a problem itself, as long as when approaching the continuum limit the lattice symmetries tend to the continuum ones.
This is the case for the translational symmetry: if $a\to0$, \eqref{3:TraslDiscr} becomes \eqref{3:TranslCont}.
However, the rotational symmetry is not restored when the continuum limit is taken (\eqref{3:RotDiscr} does not become \eqref{3:RotCont} when $a\to0$), as the Simple Hypercubic lattice is invariant under rotations of multiples of $90^\degree$ independently from the value of the lattice spacing.\\
For this reason, studies on the restoration of rotational symmetry have been made, through the computation of rotational invariant quantities.

\subsection{Rotational Invariance of the Static Quark Potential}
An example of these studies is the 1982 article of Lang and Rebbi~\cite{Lang:1982tj}, where the static quark potential $V(r)$, obtained from the correlator of two Polyakov loops (see \eqref{1:PolyakovPotential}), has been studied at different lattice spacings.
Through simulations of $\SU(2)$ lattice gauge theories the potential
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = -T\ln\expval{P^\dagger(r)P(0)} \label{3:LangRebbiPotential}
\end{equation}
has been obtained for different values of $r=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$ on lattices extending for $n_s$ lattice spacings in each of the space directions and $n_t$ lattice sites in the time direction.
Furthermore, the full gauge group $\SU(2)$ has been approximated by its discrete icosahedral subgroup $\tilde{Y}$ in order to improve the efficiency of the computation.
The varoius (about $1000$) potentials obtained for each site $r$ have then been fitted according to the expression
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = c_0 + c_1/r + c_2r \label{3:LangRebbiPotentialFit}
\end{equation}
Finally, a representation of the equipotential surfaces of expression \eqref{3:LangRebbiPotentialFit} have been plotted in Figure \eqref{3F:LangRebbi}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=0.857\textwidth]{LangRebbi_a.png}
        \caption{$\beta=2$, $n_s=8$, $n_t=4$.}
        \label{3F:LangRebbiA}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{LangRebbi_b.png}
        \caption{$\beta=2.25$, $n_s=16$, $n_t=6$.}
        \label{3F:LangRebbiB}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Representation of equipotential surfaces for larger (\ref{3F:LangRebbiA}) and smaller (\ref{3F:LangRebbiB}) lattice spacing.}
    \label{3F:LangRebbi}
\end{figure}\\
In Figure \eqref{3F:LangRebbiA} a lattice with $n_s=8$, $n_t=4$ and $\beta=\frac4{g^2}=2$ has been used, while Figure \eqref{3F:LangRebbiB} has been obtained with data from a lattice with $n_s=16$, $n_t=6$ and $\beta=2.25$.
As the lattice spacing depends, in first approximation, from $\beta$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
    a(\beta) \approx e^{-\frac{12\pi^2}{11N^2}\beta} = e^{-\frac{3\pi^2}{11}\beta} \label{3:BetaLatticeSpacing} 
\end{equation}
the first plot corresponds to a higher value of $a$ than the second one\footnote{The rigorous determination of the lattice spacing is a rather compliacted matter that will not be explained further, as it is not the purpose of this project.}.\\
As can be easily seen, by lowering the lattice spacing equipotential surfaces tend to become circles, therefore the rotational invariance, that is broken in the lattice for any value of the lattice spacing, gets restored in the expectation value of the observables, making lattice field theory a \emph{``good''} theory capable of making meaningful predictions.

\section{Other Types of Lattice\label{Sec3:Lattices}}
In section\secref{Sec1:SHLattice} the Simple Hypercubic lattice has been defined.
Of course, it is not the only possible choice, although it is the simplest.
In fact, in order to further investigate the restoration of rotational symmetry and to make better predictions on rotational invariant quantities, other types of lattices have been used to simulate lattice field theories.

\subsection{Body-Centered Tesseract\label{Sec3:BCT}}
For example, the Body-Centered Tesseract (BCT) has been used for simulation of Yang-Mills theories.
It consists of packing the spacetime with tesseracts, as the name suggests, but considering both the corners and the centers of every hypercube as lattice sites (see Figure \eqref{3F:ScBccCells} for a tridimensional representation of a cubic cell \eqref{3F:CubicCell} and a body-centered cubic cell \eqref{3F:BCCubicCell}).\\
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \hspace{0.1\textwidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.25\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{CubicCell.png}
        \caption{Simple cube.}
        \label{3F:CubicCell}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{0.2\textwidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.25\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{BodyCenteredCubicCell.png}
        \caption{Body-centered cube.}
        \label{3F:BCCubicCell}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{0.2\textwidth}
    \caption{Tridimensional representation of a simple cubic cell (\ref{3F:CubicCell}) and a body-centered one (\ref{3F:BCCubicCell}).}
    \label{3F:ScBccCells}
\end{figure}\\
Every site of the BCT lattice has, therefore, $24$ nearest neighbours: $16$ are identified by all possible sign permutations of $\pr{\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12}$, the $8$ remaining are the ones of the SH lattice.
The cell of this lattice is known as $24$-cell, shown in Figure \eqref{3F:24cell}, and the plaquettes are triangular.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{24cell.png}
    \caption{Bidimensional projection of the $24$-cell.}
    \label{3F:24cell}
\end{figure}\\
This lattice has a $1152$-elements symmetry group $G_{\Lambda_{BCT}}$, allowing a lot more rotations and reflections than the $384$ of the SH lattice.

\subsection{\spFtext Coroots Lattice}
\spFtext is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups, with Dynkin diagram \dynkin F4.
A more detailed explanation of exceptional Lie groups and algebras can be found in~\cite{adams1996lectures}.
Its root lattice is a $4$-dimensional body-centered hypercubic lattice, a BCT, while its dual, that is called the \spFtext coroots lattice, is the $4$-dimensional lattice with the symmetry group of highest order.
Each site of this lattice has $48$ nearest neighbours:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $24$ corresponding to the roots of \spFtext, individuated by all possible sign and position permutations of $(\pm1,\pm1,0,0)$;\
    \item $24$ corresponding to the coroots, the roots' dual vectors, individuated by\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\circ$] the $8$ possible sign and coordinate permutations of $(\pm1,0,0,0)$\
        \item[$\circ$] the $16$ possible sign permutations of $\pr{\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12,\pm\frac12}$\
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This lattice is made up of two BCT lattices: the first one is the dual lattice, that is the same as\secref{Sec3:BCT}, the other is the root lattice, that is a BCT with lattice spacing $\sqrt2$ as can be seen as represented in Figure \eqref{3:F4cell}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{F4_root_lattice.png}
    \caption{Bidimensional projection of the elementary cell of the \spFtext coroots lattice.\\
             The roots are represented in red and the coroots in yellow.}
    \label{3:F4cell}
\end{figure}\\
This lattice has a $2304$-elements symmetry group $G_{\Lambda_{\spF}}$, twice as the BCT symmetry group.

\section{Simulations on Higher Symmetric Lattices}
These lattices have been used, in literature, to perform Monte Carlo simulations of quantum field theories.

\subsection{Scalar Fields on \spFtext Lattice}
In~\cite{Neuberger:1987kt}, Neuberger presented the formulation of scalar fields in terms of the \spFtext lattice, where he discretized the action \eqref{1:ScalarActionEuclidean} assuming the simplest nearest neighbours interaction:
\begin{equation}
    S = \frac16\sum_{<xy>\in\Lambda}\pr{\phi(x)-\phi(y)}^2 +\sum_{x\in\Lambda}\pr{\frac12m^2\phi^2(x)+\frac\lambda4\phi^4(x)} \label{3:ScalarActionF4}
\end{equation}
where $<xy>$ indicates sum over nearest neighbours.\\
The Fourier transformation of the field $\phi(x)$ in the limit of infinte lattice volume is given by:
\begin{align*}
    \tilde\phi(k) =& \dV e^{\i k \cdot x} \phi(x) \\
    \phi(x) =& \frac1{2(2\pi)^4} \int\dd^4k e^{-\i k \cdot x} \tilde\phi(k)
\end{align*}
and the kinetic energy of \eqref{3:ScalarActionF4} at infinite volume is:
\begin{align*}
    \text{K.E.} =& \frac1{6(2\pi)^4} \int\dd^4k \abs{\tilde\phi(k)}^2\pr{\sum_\mu\pr{1-\cos(k_\mu)} +\sum_\pm\pr{1-\cos(\frac{k_1\pm k_2\pm k_3\pm k_4}{2})}} =\\
    =& \dots = \frac{1}{12(2\pi)^4} \int\dd^4k \abs{\tilde\phi(k)}^2\pr{k^2-\frac{1}{72}k^4+O(k^6)} \numthis\label{3:ScalarKE}
\end{align*}
The fact that the fourth order term is proportional to the square of the second order one is a feature of all symmetry-preserving lattice actions.\\
This work lead to some analytical~\cite{Bhanot:1990zd} and numerical~\cite{Bhanot:1990ai} results and to an upper bound prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson~\cite{Heller:1990sg} more than $20$ years before its actual discovery.

\subsection{Gauge Theories on BCT Lattice}
In~\cite{Celmaster:1982ht}, Celmaster presented the first computations for an $\SU(2)$ theory on a BCT.
Being a different lattice, where the plaquette is a triangle and not a square, like in the SH case, a new action has to be defined and one that is invariant under the BCT group and with the correct classical continuum limit is:
\begin{equation}
    S_{BCT} = \frac1{2g^2} \sum_\bigtriangleup \Re\Tr \Utriang = \frac\beta8 \sum_\bigtriangleup \Re\Tr \Utriang \label{3:BCTAction}
\end{equation}
where $\Utriang$ is the triangular plaquette, defined as
\begin{equation}
    \Utriang = U_v(x)U_w(x+\hat{v})U_{-v-w}(x+\hat{v}+\hat{w}) = U_v(x)U_w(x+\hat{v})U^\dagger_{v+w}(x) \label{3:PlaqTriang}
\end{equation}
where $v$ and $w$ are labels indicating the possible nearest-neighbours directions, described in\secref{Sec3:BCT}, such that $v+w$ is a valid direction.

        \filldraw[black]  (2,0) circle (3pt) node[anchor=north west]{$x+\hat{v}$};
        \filldraw[black]  (1,1.732) circle (3pt) node[anchor=south]{$x+\hat{v}+\hat{w}$};
        \draw[ultra thick,->] (0,0) -- (1,0) node[anchor=north]{$U_v(x)$};
        \draw[ultra thick   ] (1,0) -- (2,0);
        \draw[ultra thick,->] (2,0) -- (1.5,0.866) node[anchor=south west]{$U_w(x+\hat{v})$};
        \draw[ultra thick   ] (1.5,0.866) -- (1,1.732);
        \draw[ultra thick,->] (1,1.732) -- (0.5,0.866) node[anchor=south east]{$U^\dagger_{v+w}(x)$};
        \draw[ultra thick   ] (0.5,0.866) -- (0,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Schematization of an elementary triangular plaquette.}
    \label{3F:PlaqTriang}
\end{figure}\\
For example, if $v=(+1,0,0,0)$ and $w=(0,+1,0,0)$, then they add up to $v+w=(+1,+1,0,0)$, that is not one of the nearest-neighbours vectors, whereas $v=(+1,0,0,0)$ and $w=\pr{-\frac12,+\frac12,-\frac12,+\frac12}$ add up to $v+w=\pr{+\frac12,+\frac12,-\frac12,+\frac12}$, that is a valid direction.
In Figure \eqref{3F:PlaqTriang} an example of an elementary triangular plaquette is shown.\\
There are $96$ such triangles touching each site and each edge is shared between $8$ triangles.
By comparison, on the SH lattice there are $24$ elementary square plaquettes touching each site and each edge is contiguous to $6$ squares.\\
In~\cite{Celmaster:1983hs} and~\cite{Celmaster:1983vy} Celmaster presented the first simulation results for the $\SU(2)$ gauge theory on the BCT lattice, explaining the algorithm used for the simulations in \cite{CELMASTER1985415}.

\subsubsection{Average Plaquette Value on BCT}
In~\cite{Celmaster:1983vy} a study on the average value of the plaquette is presented: it is plotted \wrt $\beta$ in Figure \eqref{3F:AvgPlaqBCTSH}.\\
As can be seen, the BCT average plaquette better follows the strong and weak coupling expansions, that are analytical approximations valid, respectively, for $\beta\to0$ ($\Leftrightarrow g\to\infty$) and for $\beta\to\infty$ ($\Leftrightarrow g\to0$).
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.475\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AvgPlaq1.png}
        \caption{Comparison between $\expval{W_\bigtriangleup}$ on BCT and SH lattices. The short-dashed lines represent weak and strong coupling expansions.}
        \label{3F:AvgPlaqBCTSH}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.475\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AvgPlaq2.png}
        \caption{Dependence of $\expval{W_\bigtriangleup}$ on boundary conditions in different BCT lattices, with different boundary conditions.}
        \label{3F:AvgPlaqBoundary}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Average value of the plaquette $\expval{W_\bigtriangleup}$ on a BCT lattice as a function of $\beta$.}
\end{figure}\\
In the same article the influence of the boundary conditions on the average value of the plaquette is also investigated.
Three different boundary conditions are simulated: periodic, that means that lattice has the topology of a $4$-dimensional torus, free, that means that links on the boundary are free to assume any $\SU(2)$ value, and fixed, that means that links on the boundary are constrained to assume a certain $\SU(2)$ value.
The results are plotted in Figure \eqref{3F:AvgPlaqBoundary}.\\
From the plot, it can be seen that $\expval{W_\bigtriangleup}_{free} \leq \expval{W_\bigtriangleup}_{periodic} \leq \expval{W_\bigtriangleup}_{fixed}$, which is an inequality discussed by Mütter and Schilling in~\cite{Konig:1983dg}.\\
It is also pointed that computer runtime of BCT simulations was slower by a factor of approximately $2.5$ than SH simulations, but this is compensated by having $3$ times as many degrees of freedom, that become $\frac{11}{3}$ as many if a gauge fixing is done, and $\frac{16}{3}$ as many plaquettes for each site.
Furthermore, having $12$ symmetry axes instead of $4$ provides a higher symmetry of the observables allowing better checks on computations.

\subsubsection{String Tension}
In~\cite{Celmaster:1983hs} the $\SU(2)$ string tension is obtained from measurements of Wilson loops on a $6^4$ BCT lattice.
